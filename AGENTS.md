# Repository Agent Instructions

This repository hosts slide decks published via GitHub Pages.

## Remote images
- Do not add external images to the repository. Instead record their URLs in `assets/external_images.yaml`.
- Each entry in `assets/external_images.yaml` should provide a `name`, `url`, and `description`.
- Slides and documentation should reference images by these URLs rather than embedding files here.

## Local images
- Local images that must be versioned belong in `assets/images/` with descriptions in `assets/meta.yaml`.
